# Murshdi - Ramadan Companion App - Flutter Project

## Overview

**Murshdi** is a Flutter-based mobile application developed as part of the FastHacks competition, organized by IAU GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs). FastHacks encourages participants to think outside the box and create innovative solutions to positively impact people's lives during Ramadan and beyond. **Murshdi** is our innovative Ramadan Companion App, designed to enhance the experience of Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan and continue to be a valuable resource throughout the year.

## Key Features

### 1. **Locate Nearby Mosques and Prayer Locations**

During Ramadan, Muslims are encouraged to increase their prayers and worship. **Murshdi** makes this easier by helping users find nearby mosques and prayer locations with ease. Whether you're in a new city or simply exploring your local area, the app provides a convenient way to discover places to pray.

### 2. **Detailed Reviews and Recommendations**

Finding the right prayer location can be essential for a fulfilling spiritual experience. **Murshdi** offers detailed reviews and recommendations from the community to help Muslims identify the most suitable prayer locations based on their preferences. Users can read about the atmosphere, accessibility, and overall experience of each place.

### 3. **Explore Historical and Cultural Significance**

Beyond supporting worship, **Murshdi** serves as a guide to historical and culturally significant places. It enriches users' understanding of their faith and local culture by providing information about landmarks, museums, and heritage sites. This feature encourages users to connect with their heritage and explore the history and traditions of their region.
